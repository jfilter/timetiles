# TimeTiles

Welcome to the TimeTiles monorepo! TimeTiles is a data explorer for data points that have a timestamp and geolocation, along with any number of other metadata attributes. This project is built with Next.js, Payload CMS, and PostgreSQL/PostGIS for spatial data management and content administration.

This project is funded by the Prototype Fund.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

### ðŸ“¤ Event Data Import System

A comprehensive event data import system with real-time processing and automatic geocoding:

- **Multi-format Support**: Upload CSV and Excel files (.xlsx, .xls)
- **Automatic Geocoding**: Address geocoding with Google Maps API and OpenStreetMap fallback
- **Real-time Progress**: Live updates with detailed processing stages
- **Public Access**: Full functionality for unauthenticated users with rate limiting
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient handling of large datasets
- **Smart Caching**: Intelligent geocoding cache to reduce API calls

#### Quick Start Example

```bash
# Upload a CSV file via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/import/upload \
  -F "file=@events.csv" \
  -F "catalogId=your-catalog-id"

# Track progress
curl http://localhost:3000/api/import/{importId}/progress
```

Or use the web interface at `/import` for drag-and-drop file uploads.
