# Commit Guidelines

This guide outlines the commit message conventions for the TimeTiles project. Following these guidelines ensures consistency, improves readability, and helps with automated tooling.

## Commit Message Format

Each commit message consists of a **title** and an optional **body**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>
```

### Title (Required)

The title is the first line of your commit message and must:

- Be **no more than 72 characters**
- Start with a type and optional scope
- Use the imperative mood ("add" not "adds" or "added")
- Not end with a period

#### Type

The type must be one of the following:

**Feature & Fixes:**

- **feat**: A new feature for the user (not a new feature for build script)
  - Example: `feat(import): add support for Excel file uploads`
- **fix**: A bug fix for the user (not a fix to a build script)
  - Example: `fix(geocoding): handle addresses with special characters`

**Code Quality:**

- **refactor**: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
  - Example: `refactor(api): extract validation logic into middleware`
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, whitespace)
  - Example: `style(ui): fix indentation in button component`
  - Note: NOT for CSS/UI styling - use feat or fix for those
- **perf**: Performance improvements
  - Example: `perf(import): reduce memory usage by streaming CSV files`

**Testing & Documentation:**

- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
  - Example: `test(events): add unit tests for date validation`
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
  - Example: `docs(api): update endpoint examples with new fields`

**Maintenance & Operations:**

- **build**: Changes affecting build system or external dependencies
  - Example: `build(deps): upgrade to Next.js 15`
  - Example: `build(docker): optimize production image size`
- **chore**: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
  - Example: `chore(scripts): update seed data generation`

**Special Types:**

- **revert**: Reverts a previous commit
  - Example: `revert: feat(import): add Excel support`
  - Body should include: `This reverts commit <hash>`
- **security**: Security fixes or improvements
  - Example: `security(auth): fix JWT token expiration issue`
  - Example: `security(import): add file type validation`

#### Scope (Optional but Recommended)

The scope provides additional context about what part of the codebase changed. Scopes are organized into three categories:

**Apps & Packages** (where the code lives):

- **web**: Next.js web application
- **docs**: Documentation site (Nextra)
- **ui**: Shared UI components package
- **config**: Configuration packages (ESLint, TypeScript, etc.)

**Core Features** (what functionality is affected):

- **import**: File import system (CSV/Excel processing)
- **geocoding**: Address geocoding and location services
- **events**: Event data management
- **catalogs**: Catalog organization
- **datasets**: Dataset operations
- **auth**: Authentication & authorization
- **cache**: Caching strategies (location cache, etc.)

**Technical Areas** (infrastructure & tooling):

- **db**: Database operations, migrations, PostGIS
- **api**: API endpoints (REST, GraphQL, tRPC)
- **jobs**: Background job processing and queues
- **types**: TypeScript type definitions and interfaces
- **testing**: Test infrastructure and utilities (NOT individual test files)
- **deps**: External dependencies (typically used with `build` type)
- **docker**: Docker, containerization, and orchestration
- **scripts**: Utility and automation scripts
- **ci**: CI configuration files and scripts

#### Subject

The subject contains a succinct description of the change:

- Use the imperative mood
- Start with lowercase (proper nouns allowed: GitHub, PostgreSQL, TypeScript, etc.)
- No period at the end
- Be clear and concise

### Body (Optional but Recommended)

The body should use **bullet points** to clearly describe the changes. Use verbosity scaling based on the complexity of your changes:

#### When to Include a Body

**Title-only commits** (no body needed):

- Simple, self-explanatory changes
- Single-file formatting fixes
- Minor typos or corrections
- Dependency updates without breaking changes
- Examples: `fix(import): prevent duplicate events`, `style(ui): format button component`

**Commits with bodies** (bullet points recommended):

- Multiple related changes in one commit
- Complex logic changes requiring explanation
- New features with multiple aspects
- Bug fixes that needed investigation
- Performance improvements with measurable impact
- Breaking changes (always require explanation)

#### Body Format Guidelines

- Start each point with a dash (-)
- Keep each bullet point concise and focused (one concept per bullet)
- Use as many bullet points as needed to fully describe the changes
- Include context about why changes were made when it's not obvious
- Avoid unnecessary formatting (Git tools don't render markdown well)
- Use plain text with minimal formatting for maximum compatibility
- Mark breaking changes with "BREAKING CHANGE:" as a separate paragraph

Wrap the body at 100 characters per line.

## Examples

### Simple Fix

```
fix(import): handle empty CSV files gracefully
```

### Feature with Description

```
feat(geocoding): add support for OpenCage provider

- Added OpenCage as a third geocoding provider option
- Provides better coverage for European addresses
- Returns confidence scores with geocoding results
- Follows existing provider pattern for consistency
- Includes automatic fallback when configured
- Supports all existing cache mechanisms
```

### Breaking Change

```
refactor(api): change import endpoint response format

- Changed /api/import/upload response structure
- Now returns complete job object instead of just import ID
- Includes detailed progress tracking information
- Adds support for real-time status updates
- Improves error reporting with structured error objects

BREAKING CHANGE: API clients need to update to handle the new
response format. The import ID is now at response.job.importId
instead of response.importId.
```

### Multiple Changes

```
fix(web): correct type errors and improve error handling

- Fixed TaskStatus type in import-integration tests
- Added proper error boundaries to import components
- Improved error messages for failed geocoding attempts
- Updated error logging to include more context
- Added retry logic for transient failures
```

### Refactoring with Context

```
refactor(geocoding): simplify provider initialization

- Extracted provider configuration to separate modules
- Removed duplicate validation logic across providers
- Consolidated error handling into base provider class
- Improved type safety with stricter interfaces
- Reduced initialization time from ~200ms to ~50ms
```

### Bug Fix with Investigation Details

```
fix(import): resolve memory leak in large file processing

- Identified leak in CSV parser stream handling
- Fixed by properly closing streams after processing
- Added explicit garbage collection hints for large batches
- Reduced memory usage by ~60% for files over 100MB
- Added monitoring to detect future memory issues
```

## Writing Quality Commit Messages

Good commit messages tell a story about your changes. They should be written for future maintainers (including yourself) who need to understand the reasoning behind changes.

### Mechanical vs. Thoughtful Approach

**❌ Mechanical (just listing what changed):**

```
fix(import): update import-jobs.ts and add validation

- Modified fileParsingJob function
- Added new validation checks
- Updated error handling code
- Changed batch processing logic
```

**✅ Thoughtful (explaining why and impact):**

```
fix(import): prevent memory leaks in large file processing

- Added stream cleanup to prevent memory accumulation
- Implemented batch size limits for files over 100MB
- Enhanced error recovery to handle partial failures gracefully
- Reduced memory usage by 60% for large CSV imports
```

### Focus on Business Value

**❌ Technical details without context:**

```
refactor(geocoding): extract provider logic into separate classes

- Created GoogleProvider class
- Created NominatimProvider class
- Updated GeocodingService to use new providers
- Modified tests to work with new structure
```

**✅ Business value with technical context:**

```
refactor(geocoding): improve provider extensibility for future integrations

- Extracted provider logic into pluggable classes
- Enables easy addition of new geocoding services
- Standardized error handling across all providers
- Reduced provider initialization time by 40%
```

### Formatting and Text Styling

Since Git tools (GitHub, GitLab, terminal git log, etc.) have varying markdown support, keep formatting minimal:

**✅ Good formatting practices:**

- Use plain text for maximum compatibility
- Bullet points with simple dashes (-)
- ALL CAPS for emphasis when needed (e.g., "BREAKING CHANGE:")
- Simple parentheses for examples: (fixes #123)
- Avoid bold, italic, or other markdown formatting in commit messages

**❌ Avoid in commit messages:**

- **Bold text** - not consistently rendered
- _Italic text_ - not consistently rendered
- `Code blocks` - can appear as plain text with backticks
- [Links](url) - become plain text in many git tools
- Complex formatting that relies on markdown parsing

**Exception:** These guidelines (this documentation) use markdown formatting for readability, but actual commit messages should be plain text.

## Choosing the Right Type

When deciding between types, consider:

- **feat vs fix**: Is this adding new functionality (feat) or correcting existing behavior (fix)?
- **fix vs refactor**: Does this change user-facing behavior (fix) or just code structure (refactor)?
- **build vs chore**: Does this affect how the project builds (build) or is it general maintenance (chore)?
- **style vs refactor**: Is this only formatting (style) or restructuring code logic (refactor)?
- **security vs fix**: Is this addressing a security vulnerability (security) or a general bug (fix)?

## Handling Type/Scope Overlaps

Some combinations need special attention:

- **`docs(docs)`**: Valid when updating documentation app code
  - Example: `docs(docs): fix broken link in navigation`
- **`test(testing)`**: Use for test infrastructure changes
  - Example: `test(testing): add custom vitest matchers`
- **`test(web)`**: Use for adding tests to web app
  - Example: `test(web): add unit tests for import flow`
- **CI/CD changes with `(ci)` scope**:
  - `build(ci)`: CI infrastructure and configuration changes
  - `fix(ci)`: Fix broken CI pipelines or workflows
  - `feat(ci)`: Add new CI features (e.g., new checks, deployment stages)
  - `chore(ci)`: Routine CI maintenance (e.g., update action versions)
- **`build` without scope**: Use for webpack, bundling, compilation changes
- **`build(deps)` vs `chore(deps)`**:
  - Use `build(deps)` for production dependencies
  - Use `chore(deps)` for development-only dependencies
- **`style` type**: For code formatting only, NOT CSS/visual changes
  - CSS changes: `feat(ui): update button styles`
  - Code formatting: `style(api): fix indentation`

## Best Practices

1. **Atomic Commits**: Each commit should represent one logical change
2. **Focus on "Why" Not "What"**: Explain the motivation and impact, not just what files changed
   - ❌ Bad: "Updated GeocodingService.ts, added new provider, modified config"
   - ✅ Good: "Add OpenCage provider for better European address coverage"
3. **Use Bullet Points**: Structure your commit body with clear, concise bullet points
4. **Be Specific**: Each bullet point should describe a specific change or aspect
5. **Avoid Mechanical Descriptions**: Don't just list file changes or technical details
   - ❌ Bad: "Modified 3 files, added 2 functions, updated 1 test"
   - ✅ Good: "Implement rate limiting to prevent API quota exhaustion"
6. **Choose the Right Scope**:
   - Use app/package scopes for changes isolated to that codebase
   - Use feature scopes for business logic changes
   - Use technical scopes for infrastructure/tooling changes
   - When changes span multiple areas, pick the primary scope
7. **Test Your Changes**: Ensure tests pass before committing
8. **Review Before Push**: Use `git diff --staged` to review changes
9. **Amend When Needed**: Use `git commit --amend` for small fixes to the previous commit
10. **Reference Issues**: Include issue numbers when applicable (e.g., "fixes #123")
11. **Keep Bullets Focused**: One concept per bullet point for clarity

## Commit Message Template

This project includes a commit message template at `.gitmessage` that is automatically configured for use. When you run `git commit` without the `-m` flag, your editor will open with this template:

```
# <type>(<scope>): <subject>
# Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, chore, revert, security
# Scopes (optional but recommended):
#   Apps/Packages: web, docs, ui, config
#   Features: import, geocoding, events, catalogs, datasets, auth, cache
#   Technical: db, api, jobs, types, testing, deps, docker, scripts, ci
# Subject: imperative mood, max 72 chars (proper nouns allowed: GitHub, API, ES, etc.)

# Body Guidelines:
# - Use title-only for simple, self-explanatory changes
# - Add body with bullet points for complex changes
# - Focus on WHY and business impact, not just WHAT changed
# - Use plain text formatting (no markdown bold/italic)

# List your changes as bullet points (if body needed):
# -
# -
# -
#
# Add as many bullets as needed to describe all changes

# BREAKING CHANGE:
# Describe any breaking changes here

# References: #
# Include issue or PR numbers if applicable
```

The template is already configured for this repository. To use a similar template globally for all your projects:

```bash
git config --global commit.template ~/.gitmessage
```

## Tools and Automation

### Commitizen

For interactive commit message creation:

```bash
npm install -g commitizen
npm install -g cz-conventional-changelog
echo '{ "path": "cz-conventional-changelog" }' > ~/.czrc
```

Then use `git cz` instead of `git commit`.

### Commit Linting

The project uses Husky to enforce commit message standards. If your commit doesn't meet the guidelines, it will be rejected with a helpful error message.

## Quick Reference

### Title-only commits (for simple, self-explanatory changes):

```
fix(import): prevent duplicate event creation
docs(api): update geocoding endpoint examples
style(ui): format button component
chore(config): update ESLint rules

```

### When to use title-only:

- Single-file changes with obvious intent
- Formatting or style fixes
- Simple dependency updates
- Minor documentation corrections
- Clear bug fixes that don't need explanation

### Commits with bullet-point bodies:

```

```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Listing File Changes

```
❌ Bad: "Updated GeocodingService.ts, modified config.ts, added tests"
✅ Good: "Add rate limiting to prevent geocoding API quota exhaustion"
```

### 2. Technical Details Without Context

```
❌ Bad: "Add new function processCoordinates() and refactor validation logic"
✅ Good: "Improve coordinate validation to handle edge cases and malformed data"
```

### 3. Using Present Tense Instead of Imperative

```
❌ Bad: "Adding support for Excel imports"
✅ Good: "Add support for Excel imports"
```

### 4. Vague or Generic Messages

```
❌ Bad: "Fix bug" or "Update code" or "Improvements"
✅ Good: "Fix memory leak in CSV parser for files over 100MB"
```

### 5. Too Much Technical Detail

```
❌ Bad: "Refactor AbstractGeocodingProvider to implement IGeocoder interface with async/await pattern"
✅ Good: "Standardize geocoding provider interface for easier testing and maintenance"
```

### 6. Missing Business Context

```
❌ Bad: "Add new provider class and update service configuration"
✅ Good: "Add OpenCage provider to improve geocoding accuracy for European addresses"
```

Remember: Good commit messages help future maintainers (including yourself) understand why changes were made, not just what changed. Focus on business value and user impact rather than technical implementation details.
