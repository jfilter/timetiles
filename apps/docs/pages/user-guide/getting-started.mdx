# Getting Started Guide

This guide covers the basics of using TimeTiles to create interactive chronicles.

## 1. Prepare Your Data

TimeTiles works with CSV or Excel files containing events. Your data needs:

**Required fields:**
- **Date** - When the event happened (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- **Location** - Either coordinates (latitude, longitude) or addresses
- **Title** - A brief description of the event

**Optional fields:**
- Description - Detailed information
- Category - For grouping events
- Tags - For filtering
- Any custom fields

**Example CSV:**
```csv
date,title,location,category,description
2024-01-15,"Community Meeting","San Francisco, CA","Politics","Town hall on housing policy"
2024-02-20,"Protest March","New York, NY","Activism","Climate action demonstration"
```

## 2. Create Your Chronicle

1. Click **"New Chronicle"** in the dashboard
2. Upload your CSV or Excel file
3. Map your columns to TimeTiles fields
4. Review and confirm the import
5. Your chronicle is ready!

## 3. Share Your Work

Once your chronicle is created, you can:

- **Share publicly** - Get a shareable link
- **Embed in websites** - Copy the embed code
- **Export data** - Download in various formats

## Tips

- Start with a small dataset (100-500 events) to test
- Use consistent date formats
- Include as much metadata as possible for better filtering
- Check the preview before confirming import
