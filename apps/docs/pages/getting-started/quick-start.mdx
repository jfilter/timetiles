# Quick Start Guide

Get TimeTiles up and running in just a few minutes with this streamlined setup process.

## TL;DR - One Command Setup

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd timetiles
make setup && make dev
```

Then visit http://localhost:3000 and create your admin user.

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd timetiles
make setup
```

The `make setup` command will:

- Install all dependencies using pnpm
- Set up the development environment
- Configure Docker services

### 2. Start Development Services

```bash
make dev
```

This command will:

- Start PostgreSQL database with PostGIS
- Launch the Next.js development server
- Set up all necessary services

You should see output similar to:

```
✓ PostgreSQL is ready
✓ Next.js dev server started on http://localhost:3000
✓ All services are running
```

### 3. Create Admin User

Open a new terminal and create your first admin user:

```bash
cd apps/web
pnpm payload create:user
```

Follow the prompts:

- **Email**: your-email@example.com
- **Password**: Choose a secure password
- **Confirm Password**: Repeat your password

### 4. Access the Application

Open your browser and navigate to:

- **Main App**: http://localhost:3000
- **Admin Panel**: http://localhost:3000/admin

Log in with the credentials you just created.

## Verify Everything Works

### Check the Database

```bash
# Connect to PostgreSQL
make db-shell

# List tables
\dt

# Exit
\q
```

### Seed Sample Data

```bash
make seed
```

This will populate your database with sample data for testing.

### Run Tests

```bash
make test
```

Ensure all tests pass to verify your setup is correct.

## Alternative Setup Methods

### Using Turborepo Directly

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start infrastructure
make up

# Start development server
pnpm dev
```

### Manual Docker Setup

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL only
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up postgres -d

# Install and start app
pnpm install
cd apps/web
pnpm dev
```

## Common Issues

### Port Already in Use

If port 3000 is already in use:

```bash
# Kill process using port 3000
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9

# Or use a different port
PORT=3001 pnpm dev
```

### Database Connection Issues

```bash
# Restart PostgreSQL
make down
make up

# Check database status
make logs
```

### Permission Issues

```bash
# Fix Docker permissions (Linux/macOS)
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER .

# Reset Docker volumes
make clean
make up
```

## Next Steps

Now that TimeTiles is running:

1. **Explore the Admin Panel** - Visit http://localhost:3000/admin
2. **Create Your First Project** - Use the admin interface or API
3. **Start Time Tracking** - Begin logging your time
4. **Generate Reports** - View your productivity insights

## Development Workflow

### Daily Development

```bash
# Start everything
make dev

# In another terminal, watch for changes
pnpm dev --turbo
```

### Working with Data

```bash
# Reset and reseed data
make seed-truncate
make seed

# Run specific seed collections
cd apps/web
pnpm seed users projects
```

### Building and Testing

```bash
# Build for production
pnpm build

# Run all tests
make test

# Run integration tests
make seed-integration
```
