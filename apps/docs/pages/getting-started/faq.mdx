# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What exactly is an "interactive chronicle"?

An interactive chronicle is an explorable dataset that tells a story through geographic and temporal data. Unlike static reports or complex dashboards, chronicles allow readers to discover patterns by filtering, searching, and exploring the data themselves. Think of it as a guided exploration rather than a predetermined narrative.

### How is TimeTiles different from other mapping tools?

TimeTiles is specifically designed for **storytelling with geo-temporal data**, not general mapping or analysis:

- **vs. Google Maps/Leaflet**: Purpose-built for event chronicles, not general mapping
- **vs. Tableau/PowerBI**: Focused on public accessibility, not expert analysis
- **vs. QGIS/ArcGIS**: Ready-to-use platform, not a complex GIS toolkit
- **vs. Datawrapper**: Specialized for geospatial narratives with rich temporal features

### Do I need technical skills to use TimeTiles?

**For basic use**: No. TimeTiles is designed for journalists, researchers, and activists without technical backgrounds. You can import data, configure basic settings, and publish chronicles through the web interface.

**For advanced customization**: Some technical knowledge helps for custom deployments, API integrations, or using TimeTiles as a development library.

### Is TimeTiles free to use?

Yes, TimeTiles is **open source** and free to use. You can:

- Self-host the complete application on your own servers
- Use and modify the code under the open source license
- Deploy multiple instances for different projects

_Note_: Managed hosting options may be available in the future for users who prefer not to self-host.

## Data & Import Questions

### What types of data work best with TimeTiles?

**Ideal datasets** have:

- **Location data**: Coordinates (lat/lng) or geocodable addresses
- **Timestamps**: When events occurred (dates or datetimes)
- **Rich metadata**: Descriptions, categories, demographics, or other contextual information
- **Sufficient volume**: 100-100,000+ events show the most interesting patterns

**Examples**: Police incident reports, environmental violations, protest events, accident records, health data with geographic components.

### What file formats can I import?

Currently supported:

- **CSV files** (most common)
- **Excel files** (.xlsx, .xls)
- **JSON data** (API responses or exported data)
- **Manual entry** through the web interface

_Coming soon_: Direct API endpoint connections, Google Sheets integration.

### My data only has addresses, not coordinates. Will it work?

Yes! TimeTiles includes **automatic geocoding** that converts addresses to coordinates. This works for:

- Street addresses
- City/state combinations
- Landmark names
- Postal codes

The geocoding service will attempt to find coordinates for any location text in your data.

### How much data can TimeTiles handle?

TimeTiles is designed for **large datasets**:

- **Database**: Tested with 100,000+ events
- **Performance**: Server-side clustering ensures fast loading regardless of dataset size
- **Memory**: Efficient data loading prevents browser crashes with large datasets
- **Scalability**: PostgreSQL backend handles millions of records

The main limitation is import time for very large files, not runtime performance.

## Technical Questions

### What are the system requirements?

**Minimum requirements**:

- 2GB RAM
- 10GB disk space
- PostgreSQL 14+ with PostGIS
- Node.js 18+

**Recommended for production**:

- 4GB+ RAM
- 50GB+ disk space
- PostgreSQL 15+ with PostGIS 3.4+
- Node.js 20+
- Reverse proxy (nginx/Apache)

### Can I integrate TimeTiles with existing systems?

Yes, several integration options:

**As a standalone application**:

- Deploy TimeTiles as a complete web application
- Import data through the admin interface
- Embed maps in other sites (future feature)

**As a development library**:

- Use TimeTiles components in your existing applications
- Integrate with your data pipelines
- Customize the interface and functionality

**API access**:

- REST API for programmatic data import
- Query API for building custom interfaces
- Webhook support for real-time updates

### Is my data secure?

TimeTiles provides several security options:

**Private instances**: Restrict access to authorized users only
**Data control**: Your data stays on your servers when self-hosting
**Access controls**: Configure who can view, edit, or administer each chronicle
**HTTPS support**: Secure connections for all data transmission

For sensitive data, we recommend self-hosting rather than using managed services.

### Can I customize the appearance?

**Basic customization**:

- Configure colors, logos, and basic branding through the admin interface
- Choose from preset map styles and color schemes

**Advanced customization**:

- Modify CSS and styling for complete visual control
- Use TimeTiles as a library to build completely custom interfaces
- Override default components with your own implementations

## Usage & Workflow Questions

### How do I share my chronicle with others?

**Public chronicles**: Anyone with the URL can access and explore the data
**Private chronicles**: Require user accounts and appropriate permissions
**Embeddable widgets**: (Future feature) Include maps in articles or reports
**Export options**: Generate static images or data exports for traditional publishing

### Can multiple people work on the same chronicle?

Yes, TimeTiles supports collaborative workflows:

- **Role-based access**: Assign different permission levels to different users
- **Data management**: Multiple administrators can import and manage data
- **Version control**: Track changes and maintain data provenance
- **Multi-dataset**: Different team members can work on separate datasets within the same instance

### What happens if I make a mistake importing data?

- **Preview mode**: Review data before final import
- **Rollback capability**: Remove or replace incorrectly imported datasets
- **Data validation**: Automatic checks catch common formatting issues
- **Iterative import**: Add new data to existing chronicles without disrupting published versions

### Can I use TimeTiles for real-time data?

**Current capabilities**:

- Manual data updates through the admin interface
- Periodic imports from CSV/Excel files
- API-based imports for programmatic updates

**Future plans**:

- Live API connections for real-time data feeds
- Automatic polling and updating of external data sources
- Webhook integration for immediate updates when data changes

## Troubleshooting

### My map isn't loading properly

Common solutions:

1. **Check data format**: Ensure latitude/longitude columns are properly formatted numbers
2. **Verify coordinates**: Confirm coordinates are in decimal degrees format (not degrees/minutes/seconds)
3. **Test geocoding**: If using addresses, check that the geocoding service processed them correctly
4. **Browser console**: Check for JavaScript errors that might indicate configuration issues

### Import is taking a very long time

- **Large files**: Import time scales with dataset size - 10,000+ records may take several minutes
- **Geocoding**: Address-to-coordinate conversion is the slowest part of import
- **Server resources**: Ensure adequate RAM and CPU for import processing
- **Background processing**: Large imports run in the background - you can continue using TimeTiles while they complete

### I'm getting permission errors

- **File permissions**: Ensure TimeTiles can read uploaded files
- **Database access**: Verify PostgreSQL connection and permissions
- **Admin access**: Confirm you have administrator privileges for data import
- **CORS issues**: Check cross-origin request settings if integrating with other domains
