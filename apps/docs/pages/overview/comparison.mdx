## 🔍 Detailed Comparisons

### Most Similar: Timemap (Forensic Architecture)

#### Overview

Timemap pioneered timeline + map visualization for documenting human rights violations. The original is unmaintained, but active forks like [Bellingcat's Ukraine Timemap](https://github.com/bellingcat/ukraine-timemap) continue for specific investigations.

#### Key Differences

- TimeTiles: General-purpose platform | Timemap: Investigation-specific forks
- TimeTiles: Built-in data management | Timemap: External data management
- Different tech stacks and deployment approaches

### uMap (OpenStreetMap)

#### Overview

uMap creates simple collaborative maps on OpenStreetMap. Easy CSV import, rich popups, good for up to ~5,000 points.

#### Key Differences

- TimeTiles includes timeline dimension; uMap is map-only
- Different scale: TimeTiles (100k+ events), uMap (~5k points)
- TimeTiles has filtering and charts; uMap focuses on map editing

#### Best For

**uMap**: Simple collaborative maps, no time dimension needed, < 5,000 points  
**TimeTiles**: Event collections with temporal data, pattern discovery, larger datasets

### Knight Lab Tools (TimelineJS + StoryMapJS)

#### Overview

Knight Lab's tools excel at linear storytelling. TimelineJS creates beautiful timelines (≤200 events), StoryMapJS creates location-based narratives (≤100 points). Both use Google Sheets for data.

#### Key Differences

- Combined timeline + map vs. separate tools
- Exploration interface vs. linear narratives
- Different scale limits (100k+ vs. 200 events)
- Database vs. Google Sheets

### Kepler.gl (Uber/Foursquare)

#### Overview

GPU-powered analysis for millions of points with 3D visualization. Designed for data scientists.

#### Key Differences

- Different audiences: journalists/researchers vs. data scientists
- TimeTiles has integrated timeline; Kepler focuses on spatial
- Different workflows: UI-based vs. code-based

#### Best For

**Kepler.gl**: Millions of points, complex spatial analysis, technical users  
**TimeTiles**: Non-technical users, integrated timeline needs, event exploration

### Datawrapper

#### Overview

No-code tool for charts and simple maps. Popular with newsrooms for quick visualizations.

#### Key Differences

- TimeTiles: spatio-temporal events; Datawrapper: static charts
- TimeTiles: interactive exploration; Datawrapper: embedded graphics
- TimeTiles: self-hostable; Datawrapper: SaaS only

#### Best For

**Datawrapper**: Quick charts and infographics, static visualizations  
**TimeTiles**: Interactive event exploration, temporal data, self-hosting needs

### Aleph Ecosystem (OpenAleph & Aleph Pro)

#### Overview

In April 2025, OCCRP announced **[Aleph Pro](https://www.occrp.org/en/announcement/occrp-announces-a-new-chapter-for-its-investigative-data-platform-aleph-pro)** ([FAQ](https://www.occrp.org/en/announcement/aleph-pro-frequently-asked-questions-on-the-future-of-occrps-investigative-data-platform)), launching Q4 2025 with enhanced features but no longer fully open source. The community created **[OpenAleph](https://github.com/openaleph/openaleph)** to continue the open-source mission. Both handle millions of documents with entity extraction for investigations.

#### Key Differences

- TimeTiles: spatio-temporal events with map + timeline; Aleph: document analysis with entity extraction
- TimeTiles: public exploration interface; Aleph: investigative research tools
- OpenAleph: self-hostable open source; Aleph Pro: hosted platform (free for nonprofits)

#### Best For

**Aleph**: Document leaks, entity extraction, network analysis, investigative journalism  
**TimeTiles**: Event collections, pattern discovery, public-facing exploration

### Uwazi (HURIDOCS)

#### Overview

Document database for human rights organizations with basic timeline/map features. Strong on relationships and multi-language support.

#### Key Differences

- TimeTiles: event-first; Uwazi: document-first
- TimeTiles: optimized visualization; Uwazi: basic timeline/map
- TimeTiles: public exploration; Uwazi: document management

#### Best For

**Uwazi**: Document management, complex entity relationships, multi-language needs  
**TimeTiles**: Event visualization, pattern discovery, public-facing interfaces

## 🎯 Choosing the Right Tool

### Consider TimeTiles for:

- Geolocated event collections with temporal data
- Faceted search and pattern discovery
- Web-based data management needs
- Self-hosted deployment

### Consider Alternatives for:

**Linear storytelling** → TimelineJS or StoryMapJS  
**Millions of points** → Kepler.gl  
**Quick charts** → Datawrapper  
**Document investigation** → Aleph ecosystem  
**Simple collaborative maps** → uMap  
**Professional GIS** → QGIS

## Summary

TimeTiles fills a specific gap: a self-hostable platform for investigating patterns in event data through map, temporal, and faceted views. It sits between simple storytelling tools and complex GIS platforms.
