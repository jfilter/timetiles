# Core Concepts

Understanding TimeTiles' data model will help you organize and present your data effectively. TimeTiles uses a hierarchical structure to organize events, making it easy to manage multiple projects and datasets.

## 📚 The Three-Level Hierarchy

TimeTiles organizes data in three levels:

```
Catalog (Project)
  └── Dataset (Collection)
      └── Event (Data Point)
```

## 🗂️ Catalogs

A **Catalog** is the top-level container for your project. Think of it as a workspace or project folder that groups related datasets together.

### What Catalogs Are For

- **Project Organization**: Each research project, news story, or investigation gets its own catalog
- **Access Control**: Set permissions at the catalog level to control who can view or edit
- **Branding**: Customize the appearance and metadata for each catalog

### Examples

- "2024 Election Coverage" catalog containing multiple election-related datasets
- "Climate Change Research" catalog with datasets from different time periods
- "City Crime Statistics" catalog organizing crime data by year or type

### Key Properties

- **Name**: Display name for your project
- **Description**: What this catalog contains and its purpose
- **Visibility**: Public or private access
- **Theme**: Custom colors and styling options

## 📊 Datasets

A **Dataset** is a collection of related events within a catalog. Datasets share a common structure (schema) and represent a specific data source or time period.

### What Datasets Are For

- **Data Organization**: Group events that share the same structure and source
- **Schema Management**: Each dataset has its own field definitions
- **Import Management**: Data imports create or update datasets
- **Filtering**: Users can filter the view by selecting specific datasets

### Examples

- "January 2024 Incidents" dataset within a crime statistics catalog
- "Twitter Posts" dataset within a social media analysis catalog
- "Historical Earthquakes 1900-1950" dataset within a geological research catalog

### Key Properties

- **Name**: Descriptive name for this collection
- **Schema**: Field definitions and data types
- **Source**: Where the data came from
- **Import Settings**: How to process new data
- **Event Count**: Number of events in this dataset

## 📍 Events

An **Event** is an individual data point with a location, time, and associated information. Events are what appear on the map and timeline.

### What Events Are

- **Individual Occurrences**: Each row in your CSV becomes an event
- **Geolocated**: Must have a location (coordinates or address)
- **Temporal**: Should have a date/time when it occurred
- **Rich Data**: Can include any additional fields from your data

### Required Fields

Every event needs at least:

- **Title**: What happened (e.g., "Earthquake in San Francisco")
- **Date**: When it happened (e.g., "2024-01-15")
- **Location**: Where it happened (address or coordinates)

### Optional Fields

Events can include any additional data:

- **Description**: Detailed information about the event
- **Category**: Type or classification
- **Magnitude/Severity**: Numerical values for analysis
- **Source**: Where the information came from
- **Images**: Visual documentation
- **Custom Fields**: Any data specific to your use case

### Examples

```javascript
// Example event data
{
  title: "Protest at City Hall",
  date: "2024-03-15T14:00:00",
  location: "City Hall, San Francisco, CA",
  latitude: 37.7793,  // Auto-geocoded
  longitude: -122.4193,
  category: "Protest",
  participants: 500,
  description: "Climate action protest demanding policy changes",
  source: "Local News Network",
  custom_field_1: "Peaceful",
  custom_field_2: "Environmental"
}
```

## 🔄 Data Flow

Understanding how data flows through TimeTiles:

1. **Import**: Upload a CSV/Excel file to create a dataset
2. **Processing**: TimeTiles detects the schema and geocodes addresses
3. **Storage**: Events are stored in the dataset within a catalog
4. **Visualization**: Events appear on the map with filters and timeline
5. **Exploration**: Users interact with your data through the interface

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Organizing Your Data

**Use Catalogs for Projects**

- One catalog per major project or investigation
- Keep related datasets together
- Set appropriate access permissions

**Use Datasets for Sources**

- One dataset per data source or import
- Maintain consistent schemas within datasets
- Use descriptive names that indicate the content

**Structure Events Consistently**

- Use consistent date formats (ISO 8601 recommended)
- Provide clear, descriptive titles
- Include source information for credibility
- Add categories for better filtering

### Schema Design

When preparing your data:

1. **Identify Required Fields**: Ensure you have title, date, and location
2. **Plan Categories**: Use consistent category names for filtering
3. **Consider Analysis**: Include numerical fields for charts
4. **Think About Display**: What information do users need to see?

## 🔗 Relationships

The hierarchical structure creates clear relationships:

- **One-to-Many**: One catalog contains many datasets
- **One-to-Many**: One dataset contains many events
- **Inheritance**: Datasets inherit settings from their catalog
- **Aggregation**: Catalogs aggregate statistics from all datasets

## 💡 Common Use Cases

### News Organization

```
Catalog: "2024 News Coverage"
  ├── Dataset: "Political Events"
  ├── Dataset: "Natural Disasters"
  └── Dataset: "Economic Indicators"
```

### Research Project

```
Catalog: "Urban Development Study"
  ├── Dataset: "Building Permits 2020"
  ├── Dataset: "Building Permits 2021"
  └── Dataset: "Demographic Changes"
```

### Activist Campaign

```
Catalog: "Environmental Monitoring"
  ├── Dataset: "Pollution Reports"
  ├── Dataset: "Wildlife Sightings"
  └── Dataset: "Clean-up Events"
```
