# What is TimeTiles?

TimeTiles is an **open-source platform** that transforms spreadsheets of events into interactive, explorable chronicles on a map. Built for journalists, researchers, activists, and organizations, TimeTiles makes complex spatio-temporal data accessible and engaging for any audience.

### ðŸŽ¯ In Simple Terms

Upload a CSV file with events, dates, and locations â†’ TimeTiles creates an interactive map with timeline controls â†’ Share or embed your chronicle anywhere.

## The Problem TimeTiles Solves

Traditional tools fall short when it comes to geospatial storytelling:

- **Excel/Sheets**: Can't handle maps or large datasets effectively
- **BI Dashboards** (Metabase, Superset): Too complex for non-experts, dashboard-focused rather than narrative
- **GIS Tools** (QGIS, ArcGIS): Require technical expertise, not designed for public consumption
- **Custom Solutions**: Time-intensive to build, hard to maintain

TimeTiles bridges this gap by providing a **ready-made platform** specifically designed for creating interactive chronicles of geospatial events.

## Core Concepts

### Interactive Chronicles

Unlike static reports or complex dashboards, TimeTiles creates **interactive chronicles** - explorable datasets with narrative elements that allow readers to discover patterns and stories within your data.

### Event-Centric Design

Every data point in TimeTiles represents an **event** that happened at a specific:

- **Location** (latitude/longitude)
- **Time** (date/timestamp)
- **Context** (rich metadata like victim info, categories, descriptions)

### Non-Expert Friendly

TimeTiles is designed for **storytelling**, not analysis. Your audience doesn't need to understand SQL queries or statistical concepts - they can simply pan, zoom, and filter to explore your data intuitively

## How It Works

### 1. Import Your Data

```
CSV/Excel â†’ TimeTiles â†’ Interactive Chronicle
```

Bring your data from:

- **CSV/Excel files** with location and timestamp columns
- **JSON datasets** from investigations or APIs
- **API endpoints** for live data feeds
- **Manual entry** for smaller datasets

### 2. Automatic Processing

TimeTiles automatically:

- **Detects schema** and suggests optimal field mappings
- **Geocodes addresses** when only text locations are available
- **Clusters nearby events** for performance with large datasets
- **Generates visualizations** appropriate for your data

### 3. Share Your Chronicle

Deploy as:

- **Public website** for maximum reach
- **Private instance** for internal research
- **Embeddable widgets** (future feature) for integration into articles

## Real-World Examples

### Journalist: Police Shooting Database

_"I have a database of fatal police shootings and want to display it to the general public (non-experts in exploring data)."_

**Challenge**: Making 5 years of police shooting data accessible to readers who aren't data analysts.

**TimeTiles Solution**: Import CSV data with victim demographics, location coordinates, and incident details. Readers can explore patterns by filtering by victim age, race, or weapon status while seeing geographic and temporal clusters.

### Researcher: Investigation Dataset

_"I have a dump of 100k points coming out of a journalistic investigation and want to explore the data."_

**Challenge**: Analyzing massive datasets to find newsworthy patterns and stories.

**TimeTiles Solution**: Import the full dataset and use server-side clustering to maintain performance. Filter by metadata fields to identify trends, then create focused chronicles highlighting specific findings.

### Activist: Environmental Justice

_"Document pollution incidents in marginalized communities over the past decade."_

**Challenge**: Connecting environmental data to demographic patterns in a way that's compelling for policy advocacy.

**TimeTiles Solution**: Combine pollution incident data with community demographic information, allowing advocates to show clear patterns of environmental racism through interactive exploration.
