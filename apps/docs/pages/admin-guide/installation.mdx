# Installation Guide

TimeTiles can be deployed in several ways depending on your needs and technical requirements. Choose the option that best fits your use case.

## Self-Hosted Deployment

For organizations that need full control over their data or want to customize the platform.

### System Requirements

- **Node.js**: 24 or higher
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 17+ with PostGIS 3.5+ extension
- **Memory**: Minimum 4GB RAM (8GB+ recommended for production)
- **Storage**: SSD recommended for optimal performance

### Docker Deployment (Recommended)

The fastest way to get TimeTiles running locally or on your own infrastructure:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jfilter/timetiles.git
cd timetiles

# Setup and start with Docker
make setup  # Initial setup (copies .env file)
make dev    # Starts database and application
```

The application will be available at:

- **Main App**: http://localhost:3000
- **Admin Panel**: http://localhost:3000/admin
- **Documentation**: http://localhost:3001

### Manual Installation

For developers or advanced users who want full control:

1. **Clone and Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jfilter/timetiles.git
   cd timetiles
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Database Setup**

   ```bash
   # Install PostgreSQL 17+ with PostGIS extension
   # Create database and user
   createdb timetiles
   psql timetiles -c "CREATE EXTENSION postgis;"
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**

   ```bash
   # Copy environment template
   cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local
   ```

   Edit `apps/web/.env.local` with your configuration:

   ```env
   # Database connection (adjust for your PostgreSQL setup)
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://timetiles_user:password@localhost:5432/timetiles

   # Required secrets (generate secure random strings)
   PAYLOAD_SECRET=your-secret-key-min-32-chars

   # Optional: Google Maps API for geocoding
   GEOCODING_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your-api-key

   # Optional: Adjust rate limits
   GEOCODING_RATE_LIMIT=10
   ```

4. **Run Migrations and Start**
   ```bash
   cd apps/web
   pnpm payload:migrate
   cd ../..
   pnpm dev
   ```

## Production Deployment

For production deployments, additional considerations include:

- **Environment Variables**: Proper secrets management
- **Database**: Connection pooling and backups
- **File Storage**: Configure cloud storage for uploads
- **Rate Limiting**: API protection for public imports
- **Monitoring**: Application and database performance
- **Security**: HTTPS, CORS, and authentication settings

See the [Developer Documentation](/developers) for detailed production deployment guides.
