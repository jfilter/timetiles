# Use Cases & Examples

TimeTiles excels at transforming complex geospatial datasets into accessible, interactive chronicles. Here are real-world scenarios where TimeTiles provides unique value.

## Investigative Journalism

### Police Accountability
**Scenario**: Document and analyze patterns in police use of force across multiple years and jurisdictions.

**Data Sources**: 
- Police incident reports (CSV exports)
- Court records with location data
- Victim demographic information

**TimeTiles Approach**:
- Import incident data with victim demographics, officer information, and outcome details
- Enable public filtering by victim race, age, weapon status, and time of day
- Reveal geographic clustering and temporal patterns that might indicate systemic issues
- Allow readers to explore the data without overwhelming them with statistics

**Impact**: Readers can discover patterns themselves rather than being told what to think, increasing engagement and understanding.

### Environmental Investigations
**Scenario**: Track industrial accidents, spills, or permit violations across time to identify regulatory patterns.

**Data Sources**:
- EPA violation databases
- Corporate permit records  
- News reports with geocoded locations
- Community health data

**TimeTiles Approach**:
- Combine regulatory data with community demographics
- Show correlation between industrial activity and health outcomes
- Enable filtering by company, violation type, and demographic factors
- Present complex environmental justice issues in an accessible format

## Academic Research

### Conflict Documentation
**Scenario**: Document human rights violations during conflicts for academic study and legal proceedings.

**Data Sources**:
- Witness testimony with location references
- Satellite imagery analysis results
- Open source intelligence (OSINT) data
- Medical records and casualty reports

**TimeTiles Approach**:
- Create detailed chronicles of specific conflicts or incidents
- Include victim information, perpetrator data, and evidence links
- Enable temporal filtering to show escalation patterns
- Maintain detailed metadata for legal documentation while presenting accessible public interface

### Urban Studies
**Scenario**: Analyze gentrification patterns by tracking business closures, rent increases, and demographic changes.

**Data Sources**:
- Business license databases
- Real estate transaction records
- Census demographic data
- Community survey responses

**TimeTiles Approach**:
- Import multi-year datasets showing neighborhood changes
- Correlate business data with demographic shifts
- Enable exploration of specific time periods and geographic areas
- Present research findings in a format accessible to community stakeholders

## Activism & Advocacy

### Community Organizing
**Scenario**: Document landlord negligence across multiple properties to support tenant organizing efforts.

**Data Sources**:
- Building violation records
- Tenant complaint databases
- Property ownership records
- Health department citations

**TimeTiles Approach**:
- Map violations by property owner across entire city
- Show patterns of negligence by landlord and neighborhood
- Enable filtering by violation type and severity
- Create compelling evidence for policy advocacy

### Human Rights Documentation
**Scenario**: Track and document systematic persecution or discrimination for international advocacy.

**Data Sources**:
- Incident reports from affected communities
- Government document leaks
- Witness testimony with location data
- Medical or legal documentation

**TimeTiles Approach**:
- Create secure, private chronicles for sensitive documentation
- Enable detailed metadata for legal proceedings
- Support both public advocacy and confidential research
- Maintain detailed provenance and verification information

## NGO & Non-Profit Work

### Disaster Response
**Scenario**: Track disaster impacts and recovery efforts to inform resource allocation and future preparedness.

**Data Sources**:
- Damage assessment surveys
- Insurance claim data
- Government response records
- Community needs assessments

**TimeTiles Approach**:
- Combine immediate impact data with long-term recovery information
- Show disparities in response and recovery across communities
- Enable filtering by damage type, assistance received, and demographic factors
- Support both public transparency and internal operational planning

### Public Health
**Scenario**: Document disease outbreaks or health disparities to inform policy and resource allocation.

**Data Sources**:
- Epidemiological surveillance data
- Healthcare facility records
- Environmental monitoring data
- Social determinant indicators

**TimeTiles Approach**:
- Create interactive chronicles showing disease patterns over time
- Correlate health outcomes with environmental and social factors
- Enable exploration by demographic groups and geographic areas
- Present complex public health data in accessible format for community education

## Data Characteristics That Work Well

### Ideal Dataset Properties
- **10-100,000+ events**: TimeTiles handles large datasets efficiently through server-side clustering
- **Rich metadata**: 5-20 attributes per event for meaningful filtering and exploration
- **Geographic precision**: Coordinates or geocodable addresses for accurate mapping
- **Temporal range**: Datasets spanning months to years show the most interesting patterns
- **Categorical variables**: Demographics, types, statuses that enable meaningful filtering

### Common Data Transformations
TimeTiles can work with messy real-world data by:
- **Geocoding addresses** when only text locations are available
- **Parsing timestamps** from various formats
- **Detecting categorical variables** for automatic filter generation
- **Handling missing data** gracefully without breaking visualizations
- **Clustering nearby events** for performance with dense datasets

## Implementation Patterns

### Public Chronicles
- **Open data**: Make publicly available with full filtering capabilities
- **Storytelling focus**: Guide readers through key findings with narrative elements
- **Accessibility**: Ensure non-experts can understand and explore the data
- **Verification**: Include data sources and methodology information

### Research Instances  
- **Access control**: Restrict viewing to authorized researchers
- **Detailed metadata**: Include all available information for thorough analysis
- **Multiple datasets**: Combine related datasets for comprehensive analysis
- **Export capabilities**: Support further analysis in other tools

### Advocacy Tools
- **Compelling presentation**: Focus on visual impact and clear patterns
- **Specific messaging**: Configure to highlight particular findings or arguments
- **Public engagement**: Enable easy sharing and exploration by target audiences
- **Evidence documentation**: Maintain detailed records for policy or legal use
