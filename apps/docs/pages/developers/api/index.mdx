# API Reference

Welcome to the TimeTiles API documentation. This reference provides comprehensive information about all the components, services, and utilities that make up the TimeTiles platform.

## Architecture Overview

TimeTiles is built on a modern stack with Next.js 15, Payload CMS 3, and PostgreSQL with PostGIS for spatial data management. The codebase is organized into logical modules for better maintainability and developer experience.

## API Categories

### [Collections](/developers/api/collections)
Payload CMS collection definitions that define the data structure for catalogs, datasets, events, and other core entities.

### [Services](/developers/api/services)
Business logic services including geocoding, rate limiting, import processing, and schema management.

### [Job Handlers](/developers/api/jobs)
Background job processors for data import, geocoding batches, schema detection, and event creation.

### [API Routes](/developers/api/api)
Next.js API endpoints for REST and GraphQL interfaces, including event queries, import endpoints, and health checks.

### [React Hooks](/developers/api/hooks)
Custom React hooks for data fetching, state management, and UI interactions using React Query.

### [Utilities](/developers/api/utilities)
Helper functions and utilities for common operations like slugs, date handling, logging, and file processing.

### [Types](/developers/api/types)
TypeScript type definitions for schema detection, geocoding, and other core data structures.

### [Constants](/developers/api/constants)
Application constants and configuration values used throughout the system.
