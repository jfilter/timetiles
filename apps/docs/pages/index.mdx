TimeTiles is an **open-source platform** that transforms event data into interactive, explorable chronicles on a map. Built for journalists, researchers, activists, and organizations who need to make complex spatio-temporal data accessible and engaging.

## 🎯 Transform Data Into Stories

Upload a CSV file with events, dates, and locations → TimeTiles creates an interactive map with timeline controls → Share or embed your chronicle anywhere.

## Use Cases

### 📰 Journalism

Document police shootings, environmental disasters, or political events across regions. Make investigative data accessible to readers without requiring data expertise.

### 🔬 Research

Analyze historical patterns, migration flows, or disease outbreaks. Transform academic datasets into explorable narratives for broader audiences.

### ✊ Activism

Track environmental violations, human rights abuses, or social movements. Create compelling data-driven stories that drive policy change.

### 🏢 Organizations

Present corporate incidents, project timelines, or field operations. Share complex organizational data in an intuitive, map-based format.

## Why TimeTiles?

Traditional tools fall short for geospatial storytelling:

- **Excel/Sheets**: Can't handle maps or large datasets effectively
- **BI Dashboards**: Too complex for non-experts, dashboard-focused rather than narrative
- **GIS Tools**: Require technical expertise, not designed for public consumption
- **Custom Solutions**: Time-intensive to build, hard to maintain

TimeTiles bridges this gap by providing a **ready-made platform** specifically designed for creating interactive chronicles of geospatial events.
