# TimeTiles

> **Note:** TimeTiles is under active development.

TimeTiles is a data explorer for data points that have a timestamp and geolocation, along with any number of other metadata attributes. With this app, users can filter down to specific data subsets by adjusting the map's viewport (the visible area as you pan and zoom), using free-text search, or filtering by any of the metadata fields available in the dataset.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repository-url>
cd timetiles
pnpm install

# Start database
make up

# Run migrations  
cd apps/web && pnpm payload:migrate

# Start development
pnpm dev
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 to see the application.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Zustand
- **CMS**: Payload CMS with PostgreSQL
- **UI**: shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with PostGIS
- **Monorepo**: Turborepo with pnpm

## State Management

TimeTiles utilizes **Zustand** for managing global application state that does not need to be reflected in the URL. This includes UI-specific states like modal visibility, temporary form inputs, or data that is frequently updated and doesn't require direct URL sharing. Zustand is chosen for its simplicity, small bundle size, and excellent performance, providing an intuitive and less verbose API.

For state that needs to be synchronized with URL query parameters, **Nuqs** is employed. This is crucial for features where the application state should be shareable, bookmarkable, and persist across page reloads, such as map filtering, search queries, and pagination. Nuqs offers a type-safe and efficient way to manage this URL-driven state.

## Features

- **Dynamic Map Filtering**: Filter data interactively by panning and zooming the map viewport.
- Event data import system (CSV/Excel)
- Background job processing
- Geocoding integration
- Spatial data management
- Admin interface with Payload CMS
