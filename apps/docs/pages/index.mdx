# TimeTiles

> **Note:** TimeTiles is under active development.

TimeTiles is a data explorer for data points that have a timestamp and geolocation, along with any number of other metadata attributes. With this app, users can filter down to specific data subsets by adjusting the map's viewport (the visible area as you pan and zoom), using free-text search, or filtering by any of the metadata fields available in the dataset.

git clone <repository-url>
cd timetiles
pnpm install
