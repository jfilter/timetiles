# Quotas and Resource Limits

The quota system manages user resource limits and tracks usage across various operations. It prevents resource exhaustion and ensures fair usage through trust-based limits.

## Trust Levels

Users are assigned trust levels that determine their resource quotas. Higher trust levels get more generous limits.

| Level | Name       | Description                                           |
| ----- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | Untrusted  | New or unverified accounts with minimal access        |
| 1     | Basic      | Basic users with conservative limits                  |
| 2     | Regular    | Standard users with normal operational limits         |
| 3     | Trusted    | Trusted users with enhanced access and relaxed limits |
| 4     | Power User | Advanced users with generous resource allowances      |
| 5     | Unlimited  | Administrators with no restrictions (-1 = unlimited)  |

## Default Quotas by Trust Level

## Quota Types

### Active Schedules

Maximum number of simultaneously active scheduled imports. Allows users to automate data fetching from URLs on a schedule.

### URL Fetches per Day

Daily limit on URL fetch operations for scheduled imports. Resets at midnight UTC.

### File Uploads per Day

Daily limit on manual file uploads (CSV/Excel). Resets at midnight UTC.

### Events per Import

Maximum number of events that can be created in a single import operation. Prevents oversized imports from consuming excessive resources.

### Total Events

Cumulative limit on all events created by the user across all time. This is the user's overall event quota.

### Import Jobs per Day

Daily limit on import job executions (both manual and scheduled). Resets at midnight UTC.

### Max File Size

Maximum size in megabytes for uploaded files. Larger files require higher trust levels.

## Quota Enforcement

The QuotaService enforces limits at multiple stages:

### Pre-Operation Checks

Before starting operations, the system checks:

```typescript
const quotaCheck = await quotaService.checkQuota(user, QUOTA_TYPES.FILE_UPLOADS_PER_DAY, 1);

if (!quotaCheck.allowed) {
  throw new QuotaExceededError(quotaCheck.quotaType, quotaCheck.current, quotaCheck.limit, quotaCheck.resetTime);
}
```

### Usage Tracking

After successful operations, usage is incremented:

```typescript
await quotaService.incrementUsage(userId, USAGE_TYPES.FILE_UPLOADS_TODAY, 1);
```

### Daily Resets

Daily quotas automatically reset at midnight UTC via a background job:

- File uploads counter
- URL fetches counter
- Import jobs counter

Non-daily quotas (active schedules, total events) persist indefinitely.

## API Integration

### Checking Quotas

The `/api/quotas` endpoint returns comprehensive quota information:

```typescript
GET / api / quotas;
```

Response:

```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": 123,
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "role": "user",
    "trustLevel": 2
  },
  "quotas": {
    "fileUploadsPerDay": {
      "allowed": true,
      "current": 3,
      "limit": 10,
      "remaining": 7,
      "quotaType": "maxFileUploadsPerDay",
      "resetTime": "2025-10-07T00:00:00.000Z"
    },
    "totalEvents": {
      "allowed": true,
      "current": 12500,
      "limit": 50000,
      "remaining": 37500,
      "quotaType": "maxTotalEvents"
    }
    // ... other quotas
  }
}
```

### Quota Headers

API responses include quota information in headers:

- `X-User-Trust-Level`: User's current trust level
- `X-Quota-FileUploads`: Current/limit for file uploads (e.g., "3/10")
- `X-Quota-ImportJobs`: Current/limit for import jobs
- `X-Quota-ActiveSchedules`: Current/limit for active schedules
- `X-Quota-Reset`: ISO timestamp for next daily reset

### Quota Exceeded Errors

When quotas are exceeded, operations fail with a 429 status:

```json
{
  "error": "Daily file upload limit reached (10/10). Resets at midnight UTC.",
  "statusCode": 429,
  "quotaType": "maxFileUploadsPerDay",
  "current": 10,
  "limit": 10,
  "resetTime": "2025-10-07T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## Custom Quotas

Administrators can override default quotas for individual users:

### User-Specific Overrides

Set custom limits in the user's `quotas` field:

```json
{
  "quotas": {
    "maxActiveSchedules": 50,
    "maxFileUploadsPerDay": 100,
    "maxTotalEvents": 1000000
  }
}
```

Custom quotas take precedence over trust level defaults.

### Custom Quotas JSON

For additional flexibility, use the `customQuotas` JSON field to override any quota:

```json
{
  "customQuotas": {
    "maxEventsPerImport": 500000,
    "maxFileSizeMB": 2000
  }
}
```

## Usage Tracking

The system tracks the following usage metrics per user:

| Metric                   | Description                        | Reset Frequency                  |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `currentActiveSchedules` | Number of active scheduled imports | Never (decrements when disabled) |
| `urlFetchesToday`        | URL fetches executed today         | Daily (midnight UTC)             |
| `fileUploadsToday`       | Files uploaded today               | Daily (midnight UTC)             |
| `importJobsToday`        | Import jobs run today              | Daily (midnight UTC)             |
| `totalEventsCreated`     | All events ever created            | Never                            |
| `lastResetDate`          | Last daily counter reset           | Updated daily                    |

View usage in:

- User profile in admin panel (`/admin/users`)
- GET `/api/quotas` endpoint
- Response headers on quota-enforced operations

## Rate Limiting

In addition to quotas, the system implements rate limiting based on trust levels. This prevents burst abuse while quotas control overall usage.

See the Rate Limiting documentation for details on request-per-second limits and time windows.

## Implementation Details

### QuotaService Location

`apps/web/lib/services/quota-service.ts`

### Key Methods

- `getEffectiveQuotas(user)` - Get user's quota limits
- `getCurrentUsage(userId)` - Get current usage counters
- `checkQuota(user, quotaType, amount)` - Check if operation is allowed
- `validateQuota(user, quotaType, amount)` - Check and throw if exceeded
- `incrementUsage(userId, usageType, amount)` - Track usage
- `decrementUsage(userId, usageType, amount)` - Reduce usage (e.g., disabled schedules)
- `resetDailyCounters(userId)` - Reset daily counters for a user
- `resetAllDailyCounters()` - Reset for all users (background job)

### Collections Using Quotas

Quota enforcement is integrated into:

- `import-files` - File upload and size limits
- `import-jobs` - Import job creation limits
- `events` - Event creation and total limits
- `scheduled-imports` - Active schedule limits

### Background Jobs

- `quota-reset-job` - Runs daily at midnight UTC to reset all daily counters

## Best Practices

1. **Always check quotas before operations** - Prevent wasted work
2. **Provide clear error messages** - Include current usage, limits, and reset times
3. **Track usage immediately** - Don't wait for operation completion
4. **Handle admin users specially** - Skip checks or use unlimited quotas
5. **Use quota headers** - Help clients track their usage proactively
6. **Design for quota-aware UIs** - Show limits before users hit them

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements to the quota system:

- Make it configurable
- Quota usage analytics and trends
- Automatic trust level progression based on behavior
- Quota warning notifications (e.g., at 80% usage)
