# Git Configuration

This guide covers Git setup and tooling for the TimeTiles project.

## Commit Message Template

The project includes a commit message template at `.gitmessage` that helps you write consistent commit messages.

### Local Setup

The template is automatically configured for this repository. When you run `git commit` without the `-m` flag, your editor will open with the template.

### Global Setup

To use a similar template globally for all your projects:

```bash
git config --global commit.template ~/.gitmessage
```

Then copy the template to your home directory:

```bash
cp .gitmessage ~/.gitmessage
```

## Commit Validation

The project uses commitlint to enforce commit message standards. Configuration is in `commitlint.config.mjs`. This ensures all commits follow our project's specific types, scopes, and quality rules.

## Pre-commit Hooks

The project uses Husky to run checks before commits:

- **commit-msg**: Validates commit messages against our guidelines
- **pre-commit**: Runs linting and type checking (when configured)

These are automatically installed when you run `pnpm install`.

## Troubleshooting

### Commit Rejected

If your commit is rejected, read the error message carefully. Common issues:

- Subject too short (minimum 10 characters)
- Invalid type or scope
- Vague terms like "stuff" or "things"
- Missing required format `type(scope): subject`

### Editor Not Opening

If `git commit` doesn't open your editor:

```bash
# Set your preferred editor
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"  # VS Code
git config --global core.editor "vim"          # Vim
git config --global core.editor "nano"         # Nano
```

### Bypassing Hooks (Emergency Only)

In rare cases where you need to bypass hooks:

```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "emergency: fix critical issue"
```

**Note:** This should only be used in emergencies. The hooks exist to maintain code quality.
