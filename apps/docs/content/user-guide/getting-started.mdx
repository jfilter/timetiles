# Getting Started Guide

This guide covers the basics of using TimeTiles to create and explore interactive chronicles of historical events.

> **💻 Developers:** If you need to install TimeTiles locally, see the [Quick Start Guide](/quick-start) instead.

## 1. Prepare Your Data

TimeTiles works with CSV or Excel files containing events. Your data needs:

**Required fields:**

- **Date** - When the event happened (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- **Location** - Either coordinates (latitude, longitude) or addresses
- **Title** - A brief description of the event

**Optional fields:**

- Description - Detailed information
- Category - For grouping events
- Tags - For filtering
- Any custom fields

**Example CSV:**

Create a file called `sample-events.csv`:

```csv
title,date,location,category,description
"Tech Conference 2024","2024-03-15","San Francisco, CA","Technology","Annual developer conference"
"Climate Summit","2024-04-22","New York, NY","Environment","Earth Day climate action summit"
"Music Festival","2024-06-21","Austin, TX","Culture","Summer music festival"
"Science Fair","2024-09-10","Boston, MA","Education","Regional science competition"
"Art Exhibition","2024-11-05","Los Angeles, CA","Culture","Modern art showcase"
```

## 2. Import Your Data

1. **Access the Import Page**
   - Navigate to the import page (usually `/import` or via "New Chronicle" button)

2. **Create a Catalog**
   - Click "Create New Catalog" and give it a name (e.g., "My First Chronicle")
   - Catalogs help organize related datasets

3. **Upload Your File**
   - Drag and drop your CSV or Excel file
   - TimeTiles will automatically detect your data structure

4. **Review Schema Detection**
   - TimeTiles automatically identifies date, location, and title fields
   - Verify the detected schema matches your data
   - Adjust field mappings if needed

5. **Start Processing**
   - Confirm the import
   - Watch as TimeTiles:
     - Validates your data
     - Geocodes addresses to coordinates
     - Creates interactive visualizations

## 3. Explore Your Chronicle

Once processing completes, you'll see your events visualized:

- **Map View**: Events plotted on an interactive map with clustering
- **Timeline**: Time slider to filter events by date range
- **Filters**: Filter by category, tags, or custom fields
- **Event Details**: Click on any event to see full information
- **Search**: Find specific events by text search

**Pro Tips:**

- Use the time slider to see how events unfold chronologically
- Click map clusters to zoom into specific areas
- Combine multiple filters for precise exploration
- The URL updates with your filters - bookmark or share specific views!

## 4. Share Your Work

Once your chronicle is created, you can:

- **Share publicly** - Get a shareable link
- **Embed in websites** - Copy the embed code
- **Export data** - Download in various formats

## Tips

- Start with a small dataset (100-500 events) to test
- Use consistent date formats
- Include as much metadata as possible for better filtering
- Check the preview before confirming import
