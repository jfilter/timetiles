# Glossary

## A

**API (Application Programming Interface)**  
A set of protocols and tools for building software applications. TimeTiles provides a REST API for programmatic access to data import, query, and export functionality.

## C

**Chronicle**  
An interactive timeline that combines geospatial data with temporal visualization to tell a story or document events over time. The core concept behind TimeTiles.

**Clustering**  
The automatic grouping of nearby events or data points to improve visualization clarity and performance. TimeTiles clusters both spatially (by location) and temporally (by time).

**CSV (Comma-Separated Values)**  
A file format used to store tabular data. One of the primary import formats supported by TimeTiles.

## D

**Dynamic Filters**  
Interactive controls that allow users to filter and explore data in real-time without page reloads. Includes time range, location, and custom field filters.

## E

**Event**  
A single data point in TimeTiles representing something that happened at a specific time and place. Events are the basic building blocks of chronicles.

## G

**Geocoding**  
The process of converting addresses or place names into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude).

**GeoJSON**  
A format for encoding geographic data structures using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).

**Geospatial Data**  
Information that includes location data (coordinates, addresses, place names) along with other attributes.

## I

**Interactive Chronicle**  
A dynamic, explorable timeline that allows users to navigate through time and space to understand how events unfold. The primary output of TimeTiles.

**Import Pipeline**  
The system that processes uploaded data files, validates coordinates, detects schemas, and converts data into the TimeTiles format.

## J

**JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**  
A lightweight data-interchange format that's easy for humans to read and write. Supported as an import format in TimeTiles.

## K

**KML (Keyhole Markup Language)**  
An XML notation for expressing geographic annotation and visualization. Originally developed for Google Earth, now supported by TimeTiles.

## M

**Map Clustering**  
The visual grouping of multiple events that are close together geographically to prevent overcrowding on the map interface.

## P

**Payload CMS**  
The content management system used by TimeTiles for managing data, users, and configurations.

**PostGIS**  
A spatial database extension for PostgreSQL that adds support for geographic objects and spatial queries.

**PostgreSQL**  
The open-source relational database system used by TimeTiles, enhanced with PostGIS for geospatial capabilities.

## R

**React Query**  
A library for managing server state in React applications. Used by TimeTiles for efficient data fetching, caching, and synchronization.

## S

**Schema Detection**  
The automatic process of analyzing uploaded data to identify date fields, coordinate fields, and other important columns without manual configuration.

**Spatial Query**  
A database query that involves geographic locations and relationships between them.

## T

**Timeline Navigation**  
The interface controls that allow users to move through time, including play/pause controls, time range selection, and temporal zoom.

**Temporal Data**  
Information that includes time-based attributes, showing when events occurred.

**Turbopack**  
A fast bundler for JavaScript and TypeScript, used by Next.js 16 in TimeTiles for improved development performance.

## U

**URL Parameters**  
Web address parameters that store filter and view states, allowing users to share specific views of their chronicles.

## V

**Visualization**  
The graphical representation of data, including maps, timelines, charts, and interactive elements that help users understand patterns and relationships.

## W

**WebSocket**  
A communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. Used by TimeTiles for real-time updates during data import and processing.
