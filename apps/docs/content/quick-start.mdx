# Quick Start Guide

Get TimeTiles up and running in minutes. This guide will help you set up TimeTiles locally for evaluation, development, or self-hosting.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 24+
- pnpm
- Docker and Docker Compose

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jfilter/timetiles.git
cd timetiles

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Set up git commit template (optional but recommended)
pnpm setup:git

# Start PostgreSQL database
make up

# Run database migrations
cd apps/web && pnpm payload:migrate

# Start development server
pnpm dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to see the application.

## Creating Your First Chronicle

### 1. Access the Application

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser. You'll see the main TimeTiles interface.

### 2. Prepare Sample Data

Create a simple CSV file called `sample-events.csv`:

```csv
title,date,location,category,description
"Tech Conference 2024","2024-03-15","San Francisco, CA","Technology","Annual developer conference"
"Climate Summit","2024-04-22","New York, NY","Environment","Earth Day climate action summit"
"Music Festival","2024-06-21","Austin, TX","Culture","Summer music festival"
"Science Fair","2024-09-10","Boston, MA","Education","Regional science competition"
"Art Exhibition","2024-11-05","Los Angeles, CA","Culture","Modern art showcase"
```

### 3. Import Your Data

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/import
2. Click "Create New Catalog" and name it "My First Chronicle"
3. Drag and drop your `sample-events.csv` file
4. Watch as TimeTiles:
   - Detects your data structure
   - Geocodes the addresses
   - Creates interactive visualizations

### 4. Explore Your Chronicle

Once processing completes:

- **Map View**: See your events plotted on an interactive map
- **Timeline**: Use the time slider to filter events by date
- **Filters**: Try filtering by category
- **Details**: Click on events to see full information

### 5. Share Your Work

Copy the URL from your browser - it includes all current filters and can be shared with others!
