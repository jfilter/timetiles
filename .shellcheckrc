# ShellCheck configuration - minimal ignores only
# https://www.shellcheck.net/wiki/Ignore

# Set default shell
shell=bash

# Only disable what we cannot reasonably fix:

# SC1090: Can't follow non-constant source
# This is a shellcheck limitation, not a real issue
disable=SC1090

# SC2012: Use find instead of ls 
# In deploy.sh, ls is used for human-readable backup listings
# with specific formatting that's harder with find
