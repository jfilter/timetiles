# Server-Side Optimization Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Migrations Created

#### Clustering Function (`20250718_225716_add_clustering_function.ts`)
- Creates `cluster_events` function in PostgreSQL
- Grid-based clustering that varies with zoom level (110m to 55km clusters)
- Accepts bounds, zoom level, and filters (dataset, catalog, date range)
- Returns cluster ID, position, event count, and event IDs

#### Histogram Function (`20250718_225751_add_histogram_function.ts`)
- Creates `calculate_event_histogram` function
- Time-based aggregation with dynamic intervals (hour/day/week/month/year)
- Supports filtering by dataset, catalog, date range, and spatial bounds
- Returns time buckets with counts and dataset/catalog breakdowns

### 2. API Endpoints Updated

#### `/api/events/map-clusters`
- Updated existing endpoint to use the new clustering function
- Includes fallback logic when function doesn't exist
- Returns GeoJSON FeatureCollection format
- Gracefully handles missing database functions

#### `/api/events/histogram`
- Updated existing endpoint to use the new histogram function
- Includes fallback logic with basic SQL aggregation
- Auto-determines time interval based on date range
- Returns histogram data with metadata

### 3. Key Features

- **Backward Compatibility**: Both endpoints work with or without the database functions
- **Performance**: Moves computation from client to database
- **Caching**: Ready for Next.js caching (unstable_cache prepared but not enabled)
- **Filtering**: Supports all existing filters (catalog, datasets, dates, bounds)

## Next Steps

### 1. Run Migrations
When the database is available:
```bash
cd apps/web && pnpm payload:migrate
```

### 2. Test the Endpoints
```bash
# Test clustering
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/events/map-clusters?bounds={\"north\":40,\"south\":30,\"east\":-70,\"west\":-80}&zoom=10"

# Test histogram
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/events/histogram?startDate=2024-01-01&granularity=auto"
```

### 3. Update Frontend Components
The MapExplorer and chart components need to be updated to use the new endpoints as outlined in the optimization plan.

## Performance Expectations

With the database functions in place:
- Map clustering: <500ms for 100k events (from 10-15s)
- Histogram generation: <300ms (from 5-10s)
- Reduced data transfer: ~1MB instead of ~200MB for map view

## Important Notes

1. The spatial index already exists (`events_location_gist_idx`)
2. Field names use `location_longitude` and `location_latitude` (not JSONB)
3. The endpoints will work immediately but use fallback queries until migrations run
4. TypeScript and linting have been addressed
